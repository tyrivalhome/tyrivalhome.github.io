reload消息时，调用listeners.reload方法，\n        // 并将消息的data属性值传入reload方法，作为参数\n        reload: function(data) {\n            // 根据消息中得到的data，对页面进行重载\n        }\n    }\n}\nvar message = new Message(config);\n\n3. 在需要向父页面发送消息的地方调用post方法，例如：\n$(ele).on(\"click\", function() {\n    var msg = {\n        action: \"click\",\n        data: $(this).attr(\"data-index\")\n    }\n    message.post(msg);\n})\n\n\n方法：\n1. 修改Vuex Store的值\nstateProp：vuex store中的属性，例如screen.govern.showCamera\nvalue：给所有绑定的属性赋值\ncommit: function(stateProp, value)\n\n2. 修改数据绑定的值\nbinderName：binder规则的name属性\nvalue：给所有绑定的属性赋值\ncommitBinder: function(binderName, value)\n\n3. reload: function()\n重新加载报表\n\n-->\n<template>\n    <div v-if=\"!style || !style.hidden\"\n
